### The AI ROI Gap: What Recent Research Shows

Recent reports reveal a stark reality: **AI is failing to deliver measurable returns for the majority of businesses**. A widely reported MIT study—featured in outlets like *The New Yorker*—found that **95% of organizations see no measurable return** from their AI initiatives despite massive enterprise investment and widespread tool usage.<br> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-ai-profits-drought-and-the-lessons-of-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read the article on The New Yorker</a>

Another *Times of India* article echoes this finding, stating that **95% of generative AI projects in business are failing to produce meaningful outcomes**, primarily due to unrealistic expectations, poor integration, and misalignment with core business needs.<br> <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mit-study-finds-95-of-generative-ai-projects-are-failing-only-hype-little-transformation/articleshow/123453071.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read the article on Times of India</a>

As one analysis put it:

> “AI can optimize a process, but it cannot fix a fundamentally flawed one.”<br>
> This underscores a fundamental trap: **deploying AI into broken or outdated processes** is like turbocharging a tricycle—you might go faster, but you're still hindered by underlying inefficiencies.

### Why Process Redesign Comes First

Businesses often leap into AI adoption, hoping for overnight transformation. But without properly structured workflows, implementation can backfire.

**Strategic steps to consider include:**

* Mapping current processes (especially when scattered across spreadsheets, emails, or siloed tools).
* Identifying friction points that slow down operations or invite error.
* Designing future workflows that are lean, modular, and automation-ready.

Skipping this critical groundwork often leads to stalled pilots, poor adoption, and dwindling ROI.

### Outsourcing: A Strategic Enabler for AI-Driven Transformation

At Agile Tech Ops, our experience shows that **combining process redesign, AI, and outsourcing delivers the best outcomes**, especially for SMBs (small and mid-sized businesses).

#### Why this model works:

1. **Process Discipline via Outsourcing**<br>
   BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) partners bring structure, documentation, and performance transparency—creating a strong foundation for automation and AI.
2. **AI + BPO = Intelligent Labor Augmentation**<br>
   AI isn't replacing roles; it's enhancing them:
   * Bots manage routine tasks (e.g., invoice matching, ticket triage).
   * AI surfaces insights (e.g., anomaly detection) for human action.
   * Turnaround times shorten while maintaining accuracy.
3. **Scalable, Modular Infrastructure**<br>
   Offshore teams trained in prompt engineering, automation platforms (like Zapier or Make.com), and LLM assistants can integrate seamlessly, effectively becoming extensions of your core operations.

### Case in Point: Transforming Claims Processing for a Finance SMB

A finance client attempted to use an LLM for claims pre-processing—but results were disappointing: delays, context loss, and rework.

**The core issue?** Their intake process was fragmented—documents, emails, spreadsheets, and legacy portals all clashed.

**Our solution involved:**

* Using Airtable and Zapier to streamline intake workflows.
* Deploying a BPO team to clean, tag, and structure data.
* Layering in AI to auto-summarize and categorize claims before human review.

**The result?** A **58% reduction in claims processing time within 60 days**. This success wasn’t AI alone—it was optimized process and disciplined execution.

### Conclusion: AI Isn't a Silver Bullet—It’s a Force Multiplier

If your organization isn’t seeing returns on AI investments, the issue likely lies in overlooked processes, misaligned workflows, or poor change management—not just technology.

Ask yourself:

* Are your workflows built for automation and integration?
* Have you optimized, documented, and redesigned core processes?
* Could BPO or specialized outsourcing improve efficiency and amplify AI?

At Agile Tech Ops, we champion **hybrid models** where AI, human expertise, and well-designed BPO strategies work in tandem to drive true performance gains.
